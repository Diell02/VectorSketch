Overview
VectorSketch is a machine learning project that leverages the power of vectors to recognize and identify hand-drawn sketches. The project focuses on recognizing common objects such as a pencil, tree, house, car, fish, guitar, clock, and bicycle. Users can draw a sketch of an object, and the system will accurately identify and label it.
