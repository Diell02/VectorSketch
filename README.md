# VectorSketch: Machine Learning Image Recognition

## Overview

VectorSketch is a machine learning project that leverages the power of vectors to recognize and identify hand-drawn sketches. The project focuses on recognizing common objects such as a pencil, tree, house, car, fish, guitar, clock, and bicycle. Users can draw a sketch of an object, and the system will accurately identify and label it.

## Features

- **Hand-drawn Recognition:** Draw a sketch of various objects, and VectorSketch uses machine learning to identify the object accurately.

- **Vector Representation:** The system utilizes vector representations to understand and classify the hand-drawn sketches.

- **Object Categories:** Recognizes a diverse range of objects, including pencil, tree, house, car, fish, guitar, clock, and bicycle.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system and get instant feedback on their drawings.

## How It Works

VectorSketch employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset of vector representations of different objects. The model is capable of recognizing patterns and features in hand-drawn sketches, allowing it to accurately identify the objects. Users can draw a sketch using the provided tools, and the system will analyze the vector representation to determine the object.
